Landing Page Prompts

Prompt for Headline:

"GIVE ME 10 HEADLINE VARIATIONS FOR A LANDING PAGE HERO. EACH HEADLINE MUST COMBINE THREE CRITICAL ELEMENTS:
EMOTIONAL DREAM OUTCOME - The transformed state, identity shift, or ultimate life change the customer truly desires (freedom, status, control, recognition, peace of mind, etc.)
FUNCTIONAL BENEFIT WITH TIMEFRAME - The specific, measurable result they get within a concrete time period (X weeks, X days, X hours)
UNIQUE MECHANISM OR PROOF ELEMENT - What makes this possible or believable (approval rate, guarantee, specific method, etc.)
MAKE EACH HEADLINE BOLD, DIRECT, AND BENEFIT-DRIVEN. USE DIRECT RESPONSE COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES. BE VISUAL AND IMPACTFUL. PAINT THE PICTURE OF WHO THEY BECOME OR WHAT THEIR LIFE LOOKS LIKE AFTER THE TRANSFORMATION.
NO EM DASHES. NO CLEVER WORDPLAY. JUST CLEAR, COMPELLING PROMISES.
ORGANIZE THE HEADLINES IN A TABLE WITH VARIATION NUMBER ON THE Y-AXIS AND THE HEADLINE TEXT IN THE ADJACENT COLUMN.
EXAMPLE STRUCTURE TO FOLLOW:
'[Achieve Emotional Dream Outcome] [Functional Benefit] in [Timeframe] Using [Unique Mechanism] ([Proof Element])'
EXAMPLE HEADLINE: Get Business Funding Up to $2 Million in 24 Hours Using Your Property as Collateral (95%+ Approval Rate)
BREAKDOWN:
Emotional Dream Outcome: Get Business Funding (financial freedom/growth)
Functional Benefit + Timeframe: Up to $2 Million in 24 Hours
Unique Mechanism: Using Your Property as Collateral
Proof Element: 95%+ Approval Rate"

Focus these more on the end benefit and emotional dream outcome. Make it similar to the example I shared. Make the copy direct response. No em dashes please. 




Prompt for Sub-Headline:
“GIVE ME ONE MAIN SUB-HEADLINE VARIATION THAT BUILD ON THE HERO HEADLINE. ELABORATE ON THE MAIN BENEFIT AND LEAD INTO THE CTA. KEEP IT ENGAGING AND CLEAR, WITHOUT BEING TOO LONG. THE GOAL IS TO ENCOURAGE THE VISITOR TO 
SCROLL DOWN. ORGANIZE THE SUB-HEADLINES IN A TABLE WITH VARIATION NUMBER ON THE Y-AXIS AND THE SUB-HEADLINE TEXT IN THE ADJACENT COLUMN. HERE’S THE EXAMPLE: “The only inbox warm-up solution that utilizes a private network of headless browsers and AI to truly guarantee you better deliverability. Better open rates, and booked meetings within 14 days of signing up.”
Make this more benefit driven and similar to the example 
Highlight the pain point in the beginning followed by the solution 

PAIN POINT: 
Prompt for Pain Point Section (Problem, Agitate, Solve Framework)
GIVE ME 1 VERSION OF BODY COPY USING THE PROBLEM-AGITATE-SOLVE FRAMEWORK. IT SHOULD FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE:
OPENING: Start with "Dear [Target Audience]," then immediately list 3 common pain points as QUESTIONS in bullet point or checkmark format. Each question should start with "Do you..." "Are you..." "Have you..." or similar. Make them specific, relatable, and emotionally resonant.
PROBLEM: Acknowledge their pain with empathy. Make them feel seen and understood. Use "you" language to connect directly.
AGITATE: Paint a vivid picture of their frustrations. Expose the flaws in current methods and show the negative impact of sticking to the old way. Include bullet points that highlight specific 

challenges and failed attempts. Make the cost of inaction emotionally real—what are they missing out on? What's slipping away?
SOLVE: Transition with hope. Clarify what they DON'T need (to dismantle objections), then introduce what they DO need. Present your solution as the clear alternative that addresses the root cause. Include proof elements like results, timeframes, or social proof if applicable.
FORMATTING RULES FOR MAXIMUM SCANNABILITY:
Keep sentences to 15 words or less whenever possible
Maximum 2 sentences per paragraph
Use single-line paragraphs frequently to create white space
Bold or capitalize key phrases for emphasis (e.g., "NOTHING worked" or "WITHOUT surgery")
Break up text every 2-3 lines
Use bullet points with checkmarks for lists of benefits or pain points
Write conversationally, like you're talking to a friend
DO NOT USE EM DASHES (—) OR EN DASHES (–). USE ONLY AMPERSANDS (&), COMMAS, OR THE WORD "AND" TO CONNECT IDEAS.

Prompt for Pain Point Headline: 
GIVE ME 5 HEADLINE VARIATIONS TO INTRODUCE THE PAIN TO PROOF SECTION OF THE LANDING PAGE. THIS HEADLINE BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN THE READER'S FRUSTRATION AND THE SOLUTION YOU'RE ABOUT TO PRESENT. EACH HEADLINE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE PAIN AND HINT AT THE SOLUTION. VARY THE STRUCTURE—DO NOT DEFAULT TO THE QUESTION-ANSWER FORMAT FOR EVERY HEADLINE. USE THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES: Direct warning or guidance statement (e.g., "Avoid X by doing Y") Pain callout with reframe (e.g., "Feeling X? It's not Y, it's Z") Empathy question with solution (e.g., "Frustrated by X? Here's the fix") Bold claim that challenges their assumptions Single-sentence statement that validates pain and promises resolution CRITICAL: MIX UP THE FORMATS. DO NOT MAKE EVERY HEADLINE A QUESTION FOLLOWED BY AN ANSWER. AIM FOR ONLY 2-3 QUESTIONS OUT OF 5 HEADLINES. USE CONVERSATIONAL, EMPATHETIC LANGUAGE THAT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE READING THEIR MIND. THE TONE SHOULD BUILD TRUST AND POSITION YOU AS THE EXPERT WHO UNDERSTANDS. KEEP HEADLINES UNDER 20 WORDS. BE DIRECT AND SPECIFIC. DO NOT USE EM DASHES (—) OR EN DASHES (–). USE ONLY AMPERSANDS (&), COMMAS, OR THE WORD "AND" TO CONNECT IDEAS. ORGANIZE THE HEADLINES IN A TABLE WITH VARIATION NUMBER ON THE Y-AXIS AND THE HEADLINE TEXT IN THE ADJACENT COLUMN. HERE ARE EXAMPLE HEADLINES WITH DIFFERENT STRUCTURES: Avoid pain & regret by choosing the right vasectomy doctor Feeling tired all the time & losing strength? It's not just aging, it's low T Frustrated after trying everything to fix dizziness? Here's the real fix.




VALUE PROPS 

Identification Of Value Props: 
ANALYZE ALL THE INFORMATION I'VE PROVIDED ABOUT THIS COMPANY AND IDENTIFY THE TOP 8 UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITIONS AND DIFFERENTIATORS. FOCUS ON WHAT MAKES THIS COMPANY DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM COMPETITORS.
FOR EACH VALUE PROP, CREATE A HEADLINE THAT COMBINES THE FEATURE WITH THE EMOTIONAL BENEFIT TO ANSWER "WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?" MAKE THEM SPECIFIC, TANGIBLE, AND EMOTIONALLY COMPELLING.
CRITICAL RULES:
Each value prop MUST be completely unique and distinct
NO repeats, overlaps, or reworded versions of the same point
If you cannot find 8 truly unique differentiators, limit the number to whatever is genuinely distinct (5, 6, 7, etc.)
Tell me upfront if you're providing fewer than 8 and why
Focus on REAL differentiators, not generic benefits every competitor could claim

EACH HEADLINE SHOULD FOLLOW THIS FORMULA: [ACTION/EXPERIENCE VERB] + [SPECIFIC FEATURE/WHAT THEY GET] + [EMOTIONAL BENEFIT/DREAM OUTCOME]
FOCUS ON TRANSFORMATION, NOT JUST TRANSACTION. THE BENEFIT SHOULD SPEAK TO:
Freedom & peace of mind
Confidence & control
Long-term security or permanence
Ease & simplicity
Status or capability they'll gain
KEEP HEADLINES BETWEEN 12-18 WORDS. BE CONCRETE AND SPECIFIC WITH NUMBERS, TIMEFRAMES, OR GUARANTEES WHEN POSSIBLE.
